# **Maze Game**
## *A C++ Based Project Using Dijkstra's Algorithm To Find Shortest Paths Between Coordinates Of The Maze*

### **Things To Be Kept In Mind For Playing The Game :**
- You Can Calculate **-The Shortest Distance-** From One Cell To Another.
- You Can Change The Contents Of The Maze As Well.
- '#' Represents A Blocked Cell.
- Numeric Values (0 - 9) Mean Weights Of The Cell.
- You Can Start By Entering Any Valid Dimension (M x N) You Like.

#### **How To Run The Program :**
- You should have a working C++ Compiler.
- After Saving The Folder On Your System, Go To The Directory You Saved It Via CMD Or Terminal.
- Write -> **-"g++ .\Maze.cpp"-** And Hit Enter.
- After That Run The Executable File By Writing -> **-".\a.exe"-** On The Same Terminal
- Your Program Is Now Running Successfully, Go Interact It With As You Want.

#### **How To Interact With The Program :**
- Enter Valid Dimensions (M x N) For A Maze You Want To Start With.
- After This There Are 6 Options Available ->
  - Press 1 To Find Distances Between Any Two Coordinates. You Have To Enter The Source And Destination Coordinates After Pressing 1.
  - Press 2 To Unblock A Cell. You Have To Enter The Coordinate Of The Cell You Wish To Block.
  - Press 3 To Block A Cell. You Have To Enter The Coordinate Of The Cell You Wish To Unblock.
  - Press 4 To Change The Cell Weight. Enter The Coordinate Of The Cell Whose Weight You Want To Alter. Also Enter The New Weight.
  - Press 5 To Print The Maze On Your Screen.
  - Press 6 To Exit The Maze Game.
